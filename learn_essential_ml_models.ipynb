        "1 | Supervised - Regression  | **Linear Regression** | 1. Data will be plotted into x,y axis grap <br> 2. Need to find best fit line which connect or minimize the distance from all data points <br> 3. this best fit line has the equation `y = mx + c` and act as a model | Pros: This is simple and easy to implement <br> **Cons:** In real world, its not possible to craete a best fit line which connect all data points.\n",
        "2 | Supervised - Regression | **Decision Tree** | 1. It will break into multiple rules like tree like structure, then it will predict | pros: It has no complex algorithm <br> **Cons:** Model can be overfitted and small changes in feature can impact the model\n",
        "3 | Supervised - Regression | **Random Forest** | 1. It will create multiple decission trees with random rows and columns <br> 2. In prediction, Random forest will output the average from all decission trees. <br> 3. Its an **Ensemble Learning with parralel way**. |\n",
        "4 | Supervised - Regression | **Ada Boost** <br> Adaptive Boosting | 1. In Boost, model assign initial weights to all observations <br> 2. All rows are qqually important at beginning, then it changes the weights based on previous mistakes the model made <br> 3. Its an **Ensemble Learning with sequential way**. <br> 4. Here all trees will be look like stumbs (only 1 level of decission trees) <br> 5. weights will be changed/adjusted based on the **Residuals (errors)**. More Residuals, more weights will be added | Pros: It will be better model <br> **Cons:** Its a black box model and also need more resources, data to train the model.\n",
        "5 | Supervised - Regression | **Gradient Boost** | 1. Its also an **Ensemble Learning with sequential way**. <br> 2. First, its create a base average model and then computeit residuals/ errors <br> 3. based on residuals, model try to minimize the residuals to fit the model and update the base model | Pros: Its very famous and most used model in kaggle competition <br> **Cons:** Its a complex model\n",
        "6 | Supervised - Regression | **XG Boost** <br> Exponential Gradient Boost | 1. Its different from Gradient Boost model |\n",
        "7 | Supervised - Classification | **Logistic Regression** | 1. Its only work with sigmoid equation (inverse of log function) <br> | **Cons:** It may not give accurate result all the time\n",
        "8 | Supervised - Classification | **KNN** <br> K-Nearest Neighbors | 1. It will try to allocate neighbors to all these individual observations and get the mod of neighbors to predict |\n",
        "9 | Supervised - Classification | **SVM** <br> Support Vector Machines | 1. Its try to create some decission boundaries <br> 2. In real world, its difficult to find simple decission boundaries <br> 3. So we need to specify **Hyperplanes** and **Kernels** to build complex decission boundaries | **Cons:**\n",
        "10 | Unsupervised | **K-means Clustering** | 1. It will create the group or cluster of similar data <br> 2. To find the similar data, its checking the distances between dataplots and if distance is less, create the group with that elements <br> 3. Check **Centroid** options for K-means |\n",
        "11 | Unsupervised | **Collaborative filtering** | 1. For an example, It will create matrix like table with User and Items. <br> 2. Then it will check for other similar users and predict the items | Pros: Used for recommendation systems\n",
